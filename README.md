# JAssure
JAssure– The foundation of API-first development that Guarantees API correctness
## 🚀 Product Description
JAssure is a next-generation API-first development framework that turns your OpenAPI specification into the single source of truth for building, validating, testing, and consuming APIs.

Designed to work like Lombok for APIs, it eliminates boilerplate and enforces strict contract compliance by generating server controllers, runtime validation, typed clients, and test mocks directly from OpenAPI specifications.

With JAssure, teams can design APIs first, implement faster, prevent contract drift, and ship reliable services with confidence.
## 🔑 Key Value Proposition

Design once in OpenAPI. Get production-ready servers, clients, validation, and tests automatically.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🧩 API-First Server Development

Generate controller interfaces directly from OpenAPI

Framework-agnostic runtime support (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus)

Developers implement only business logic — no request parsing or validation code

### ✅ Runtime Contract Validation

Automatic validation of request and response payloads against the OpenAPI spec

Enforces schema rules, formats, enums, constraints, and types at runtime

Prevents undocumented or invalid API behavior in production

###  🌐 Typed Client Generation

Generate strongly-typed web clients for external and internal APIs

Built-in support for retries, authentication, timeouts, and interceptors

Keeps clients always in sync with API changes

### 🧪 Mocking & Testing Support

Auto-generate mock servers from OpenAPI for unit and integration tests

Generate realistic mock data based on schema definitions

Validate test inputs and outputs against the API contract

### 🛠 Developer Tooling

CLI and build plugins (Maven / Gradle)

Watch mode for auto-regeneration on spec changes

Designed for CI/CD and contract testing pipelines

## 🎯 Who It’s For

- Backend engineers building microservices
- Platform and API teams enforcing standards
- Enterprises adopting API-first or contract-driven development
- Teams struggling with client/server drift and manual validation

## 📦 Outcome for Teams

- ⏱ Faster API development
- 🧾 Guaranteed contract compliance
- 🐞 Fewer production bugs
- 🔄 Zero drift between API, clients, and documentation
- 🧪 Stronger testing with minimal effort
